Code-Fellows-final
==================

This project represents the final assignment for the Code Fellows Foundations class. We were tasked with Visualizing a Data Structure's Algorithm in some way so I chose to illustrate a story of efficiency between two sorting algorithms. Everything is explained on the final project page at the demo below.

Some notes:
- I used generic sorting algorithm functions found online, which are referenced in the code as comments
- The demo page uses the Minimalist theme at github, but I separated my own custom styles into a seperate sheet, leaving the original theme styles untouched.
- all told, the project took about 6-8hrs of work over the course of a couple days, most of it was javascript debugging.
