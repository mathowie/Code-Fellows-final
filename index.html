        <h3>A Story</h3>

<p>A friend interviewed at Google in early 2003, hoping to get a job as a front-end web developer. The interviewer asked him one of those famous tech startup brain teaser questions, and now that I've completed this class, I can understand they were simply separating applicants that had some sort of traditional computer science background from those that did not (this friend was a musician and web design guy that taught himself javascript). The brain teaser at the job interview was as follows:</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
You are standing next to an empty 100-story building. You have at your disposal 100 ostrich eggs. Remember that ostrich eggs are very tough to crack, often requiring a hammer in the kitchen. I want you to tell me the process of how you would figure the highest floor of the building you can drop an ostrich egg without breaking.
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  At the time, my friend asked me how I would answer it. Not knowing anything about real programming (I was a web designer with a bit of simple server-side scripting experience), I answered that I'd take all 100 eggs, and start walking up the stairs, stopping at floor 1 to drop an egg and wait, then climbing to floor 2 and trying again, and so on, until I got the answer. He answered the same way to the interviewer, and didn't get the job.
</p>

<h3>Calculating the Answer</h3>

<p>First, we build a random number generator to give us an answer upfront that we will use to compare sorting algorithms. The code is simple and as follows:</p>

<code><pre>
var answer;
answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
</pre></code>

<p>
  Push the button below to pick a random floor number that will serve as the answer
</p>

<p>
  <form><input type="submit" value="Calculate random answer" class="randomnumber"></form>
</p>

<p>
  We'll now create a building in CSS using some simple drawing commands to represent our answer. The following building is x floors high
</p>

<p>
  <div class="building"></div>  
</p>

<h3>
  Creating an array
</h3>

<p>
  Next, we create a 100 item array representing the total floors in the building
</p>

<code><pre>
function range(a, b) {
  var arr = [];

  while (a < b + 1) {
    arr.push(a++);
  }

  return arr;
}

console.log(range(1, 100)

</pre></code>


<h3>
  Sorting the arrays
</h3>

<p>
  Next, we will sort the arrays, using a purposely inefficient method and compare it to an efficient method, counting the number of iterations required to sort the previously created array for the random number of floors calculated at the start of this exercise.
</p>

<h4>
  Bubble sort
</h4>

<p>
  The bubble sort represents our inefficient method 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
